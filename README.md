# **ASN Grabber - Chrome Extension** 🚀  

**ASN Grabber** is a **Chrome extension** that helps users **automatically search, extract, and manage ASN (Autonomous System Number) information** from Google search results. With just a **company name**, the tool performs a **Google search**, grabs all ASN numbers from the search results, and allows users to **copy or clear** them with one click.

## **🔹 Features**  
✅ **Automatic ASN Lookup** – Enter a company name, and the tool searches `Google` for ASN details.  
✅ **Live ASN Extraction** – Dynamically extracts ASN numbers from search results.  
✅ **Real-Time Monitoring** – Uses a `MutationObserver` to detect and extract ASNs when search results update.  
✅ **Copy to Clipboard** – One-click copy option to export ASN numbers easily.  
✅ **Clear ASN List** – Reset stored ASNs anytime.  
✅ **Search & Filter** – Quickly filter extracted ASNs within the popup.
